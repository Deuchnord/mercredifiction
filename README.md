## What is _#MercrediFiction_?

_\#MercrediFiction_ is an initiative from the French-speaking community on Mastodon that invites
each member of the social network to tell, each Wednesday, a fictive story in (generally)
500-characters or less, with the hashtag - you guessed it! - _#MercrediFiction_ (which may be translated as
_#FictionWednesday_).
Started very early when the French community landed on Mastodon, the initiative continued its way
and became soon a tradition.

## About this project

After more than one year of fictions on Mastodon, it became a little difficult to see all new
fictions. Plus, the more time passes, the more the oldest fictions become inaccessible.

The goal of this project is to make it easier to read all the fictions of an author by enhancing
their presentation on a website that makes them more visible.
